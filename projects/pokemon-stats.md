For this project, I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Pokémon stats dataset from Kaggle. Leveraging Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for interactive visualizations, I uncovered key patterns and insights about Pokémon attributes, such as types, stats, and distributions. The project aimed to provide a better understanding of the dataset through clear, visual representations of the data’s underlying trends.

### Write-up
I’ve shared my process and findings in a detailed Medium article, where I walk through the steps of my analysis.
