    <h1 class="display-4">About me</h1>

    <p> Phonetic spelling of my name: <b>SHRĒ-vid-yə Chun-druh-SHĀ-kuh-run </b></p>
    
    <p>Hello, I'm Sri! I am a passionate and collaborative software engineer with 6 years of experience dedicated to delivering impactful solutions that make a difference.</p>

    <p>My journey began at Nokia, where I dove into the world of R&D as a Software Engineer, focusing on backend design and development in Java for a cutting-edge containerized customer support web application. I then took on the role of a R&D Cloud Native Software Engineer on a platform team, where I contributed in transforming a monolithic application into an effective cloud-ready solution, and worked towards its evolution into a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering on AWS.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I'm the kind of person who's enthusiastic and always excited to dive into new activities. I enjoy cooking, playing pickleball and badminton, hiking, painting, and solving word puzzles. I'm also passionate about crafting, especially with clay and polymer clay, and love making things by hand. Trip planning is another hobby of mine, and I'm always learning about new destinations, local cuisines, and unique experiences to explore. I can be pretty high energy and love staying active, whether it's through sports or creative projects!</p>
